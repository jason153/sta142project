about the heart disease problem prediction
For this project, we use a dataset that includes information about heart disease. This data all uses numerical variables to show the information. This includes age, sex, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, and so on. We will use the data set from UCI to perform a simple heart disease prediction algorithm by using statistical learning methods including K-nn classification, cross validation, and logistic regression. Moreover, we want to determine the importance of each variable and the relationship between each variable with heart disease. To be more specific, we first find the correlation table for each variable. Then, as we can see from the graph, we primarily target a few variables. Then we will use K-nn and logistic lasso to make predictions. Furthermore, we use the confusion matrix to try to determine the correct rate of prediction. And we use the original table to compare with the table that only includes the important variables. Our null hypothesis is that the variables, sex, age, cp, and thalach have an influence on whether the target has heart disease or not.
